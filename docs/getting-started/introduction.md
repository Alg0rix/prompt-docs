# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the Prompt Engineering Guide!

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with AI. However, getting the desired output often requires more than just asking a simple question. This is where **Prompt Engineering** comes in.

**Prompt Engineering** is the art and science of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide LLMs towards generating accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

## What You'll Learn

This guide will cover:

- **Fundamentals:** What prompt engineering is and why it's crucial.
- **Basic Techniques:** Simple yet powerful methods like zero-shot, few-shot, and role-based prompting.
- **Advanced Strategies:** More complex techniques such as Chain-of-Thought, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and prompt chaining.
- **Specialized Prompts:** Techniques tailored for specific tasks like function calling, multi-modal interactions, and constraining output.
- **Best Practices:** Tips and guidelines for writing effective prompts.
- **Responsible AI:** Considerations around safety, ethics, bias, and mitigating risks like prompt injection.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, writer, or just curious about LLMs, this guide provides the knowledge to effectively leverage the power of these models.
