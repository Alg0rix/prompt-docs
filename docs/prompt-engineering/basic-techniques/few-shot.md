# Few-shot Prompts

Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique where you provide the model with a small set of examples demonstrating the desired task before asking it to perform a similar task. This approach helps the model understand patterns and expectations through demonstration.

## Key Concepts

- **Learning from Examples**: The model learns from provided examples
- **Pattern Recognition**: Examples demonstrate desired patterns and formats
- **Consistent Structure**: Examples follow a uniform format
- **Implicit Rules**: Rules are demonstrated rather than explicitly stated

## Best Practices

1. **Example Selection**
   - Choose diverse, representative examples
   - Include edge cases when relevant
   - Maintain consistent quality across examples
   - Use realistic, accurate content

2. **Structure and Format**
   - Maintain consistent formatting across examples
   - Use clear separators between examples
   - Follow input-output pairs pattern
   - Keep example format identical to the target task

3. **Example Quantity**
   - Use 2-5 examples for basic tasks
   - Include more examples for complex patterns
   - Balance comprehensiveness with conciseness
   - Consider model context window limitations

## Examples

### Basic Format
```
Input: "The food was delicious"
Output: Positive

Input: "The service was terrible"
Output: Negative

Input: "The restaurant was okay"
Output: Neutral

Input: "The ambiance was fantastic but the prices were too high"
Output: [Your task: classify the sentiment]
```

### Complex Pattern
```
Text: "Red roses bloom in spring"
Analysis:
- Subject: roses
- Color: red
- Action: bloom
- Time: spring

Text: "Tall trees sway in the wind"
Analysis:
- Subject: trees
- Attribute: tall
- Action: sway
- Condition: in the wind

Text: "The old car rusts in the garage"
Analysis:
[Your task: complete the analysis]
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Inconsistent Examples**
   - Mixed formats across examples
   - Inconsistent complexity levels
   - Varying levels of detail
   - Contradictory patterns

2. **Poor Example Selection**
   - Too similar examples
   - Unrepresentative cases
   - Overly simplistic examples
   - Biased example sets

3. **Format Issues**
   - Unclear separation between examples
   - Inconsistent structure
   - Missing crucial elements
   - Confusing layout

## Use Cases

1. **Format Conversion**
   - Data transformation
   - Style adaptation
   - Template filling
   - Format standardization

2. **Analysis Tasks**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Structure extraction
   - Content classification
   - Feature identification

3. **Creative Tasks**
   - Writing style matching
   - Content generation
   - Format-specific creation
   - Pattern-based outputs

## When to Use Few-shot

Few-shot prompting is ideal when:
- The task requires specific formatting
- You need consistent output structure
- The pattern is best learned by example
- Zero-shot attempts produce inconsistent results

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other techniques when:
- Examples would take too much context space
- The task is simple and well-defined
- Pattern demonstration isn't necessary
- Zero-shot prompting works sufficiently

## Tips for Success

1. **Example Design**
   - Create clear, representative examples
   - Include variety while maintaining consistency
   - Demonstrate key variations
   - Show edge cases when relevant

2. **Format Optimization**
   - Use clear, consistent separators
   - Maintain identical structure across examples
   - Include all relevant components
   - Make patterns easily identifiable

3. **Quality Control**
   - Test with different inputs
   - Verify pattern recognition
   - Check for consistency
   - Validate edge cases

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Examples**
   - Adapt examples to specific contexts
   - Use domain-specific instances
   - Scale complexity progressively
   - Include relevant variations

2. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - Combine with explicit instructions
   - Mix with other prompt types
   - Include explanatory elements
   - Add context when needed
