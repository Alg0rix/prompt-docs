# Instruction-following Prompts

Instruction-following prompts are designed for models trained to follow explicit instructions, often leveraging reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or instruction tuning. These prompts enable more reliable, controllable, and user-aligned outputs.

## Key Concepts

- **Explicit Instructions**: The prompt directly tells the model what to do.
- **Instruction-tuned Models**: Models trained to follow instructions (e.g., via RLHF).
- **User Alignment**: Outputs are tailored to user intent and requirements.
- **Controllability**: The modelâ€™s behavior is more predictable and consistent.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Clear and Direct**
   - Use unambiguous language.
   - Specify the task, format, and any constraints.

2. **Leverage Model Capabilities**
   - Use instruction-following models for tasks requiring compliance.
   - Test with different phrasings to optimize results.

3. **Combine with Examples**
   - Pair instructions with one-shot or few-shot examples for clarity.
   - Show both correct and incorrect outputs if needed.

4. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Adjust instructions based on model performance.
   - Use feedback to improve prompt effectiveness.

## Examples

### Basic Instruction-following
```
Write a summary of the following article in three sentences or less.
[Insert article text here]
```

### Formatting and Style
```
List the main points from the text below. Respond in bullet points.
Text: "Exercise improves mood, boosts energy, and supports heart health."
```

### Task-specific Instruction
```
Translate the following sentence to German, using formal language.
Sentence: "How are you today?"
```

### Multi-step Instruction
```
First, extract all dates from the text. Then, summarize the main event for each date.
Text: "The conference was held on March 10th. The results were published on April 2nd."
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague or Ambiguous Instructions**
   - Not specifying the desired output format or style.
   - Leaving room for interpretation that leads to inconsistent results.

2. **Overly Complex Instructions**
   - Combining too many tasks in one prompt.
   - Making the prompt difficult for the model to follow.

3. **Ignoring Model Limitations**
   - Expecting the model to follow instructions beyond its capabilities.
   - Not testing for edge cases or ambiguous scenarios.

4. **Lack of Feedback**
   - Not refining prompts based on model outputs.
   - Failing to provide corrective examples.

## Use Cases

1. **Summarization**
   - Article or document summaries
   - Meeting notes

2. **Data Extraction**
   - Entity or fact extraction
   - Structured data generation

3. **Translation and Paraphrasing**
   - Language translation
   - Rewriting for tone or style

4. **Task Automation**
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Workflow guidance

## When to Use Instruction-following Prompts

Instruction-following prompts are ideal when:
- The task requires precise compliance with user instructions.
- Consistency and predictability are important.
- The model is instruction-tuned or RLHF-trained.
- User alignment is a priority.

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other techniques when:
- The task benefits from demonstration (use one-shot or few-shot).
- The model is not instruction-tuned and struggles with compliance.
- Open-ended or creative outputs are desired.

## Tips for Optimization

1. **Iterative Testing**
   - Refine instructions based on model outputs.
   - Test with different phrasings for clarity.

2. **Combine with Examples**
   - Use examples to reinforce instructions.
   - Show both correct and incorrect outputs if needed.

3. **Monitor for Drift**
   - In multi-turn conversations, restate instructions as needed.
   - Remind the model of constraints if it deviates.

4. **Validate Outputs**
   - Check for compliance with instructions.
   - Revise prompts if results are inconsistent or off-target.
