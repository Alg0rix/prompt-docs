# Prompt Chaining/Workflow Prompts

Prompt chaining or workflow prompting involves linking multiple prompts together, where the output of one prompt becomes the input for the next, enabling complex multi-step reasoning or task completion. This technique is essential for orchestrating advanced workflows and decomposing large problems.

## Key Concepts

- **Chained Prompts**: Multiple prompts are executed in sequence, passing information between steps.
- **Intermediate Outputs**: Each step produces an output that informs the next prompt.
- **Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken into manageable sub-tasks.
- **Workflow Automation**: Enables multi-step processes and decision trees.

## Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Steps**
   - Break the overall task into logical, sequential steps.
   - Clearly specify the goal of each prompt in the chain.

2. **Maintain Context**
   - Pass relevant information from one step to the next.
   - Use structured formats (e.g., JSON, lists) for intermediate outputs.

3. **Test Each Step Independently**
   - Validate that each prompt works as intended in isolation.
   - Check for errors or ambiguities before chaining.

4. **Handle Errors and Edge Cases**
   - Anticipate possible failures at each step.
   - Include fallback prompts or error handling logic.

## Examples

### Basic Prompt Chain
```
Step 1: Summarize the following article.
[Insert article text]

Step 2: Based on the summary, list three key takeaways.
```

### Data Extraction Workflow
```
Step 1: Extract all dates from the text.
Step 2: For each date, summarize the main event.
Step 3: Organize the results in a table.
```

### Multi-step Reasoning
```
Step 1: Identify the main problem described in the scenario.
Step 2: Suggest three possible solutions.
Step 3: Evaluate the pros and cons of each solution.
```

### Automated Research Assistant
```
Step 1: Search for recent articles on a topic.
Step 2: Summarize each article.
Step 3: Synthesize the summaries into a report.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Loss of Context**
   - Failing to pass necessary information between steps.
   - Forgetting intermediate results.

2. **Step Dependency Issues**
   - Later steps depend on outputs that may be missing or malformed.
   - Not validating outputs before proceeding.

3. **Overly Complex Chains**
   - Too many steps make the workflow hard to manage.
   - Increased risk of error propagation.

4. **Inconsistent Formats**
   - Using different formats for intermediate outputs.
   - Making it difficult to parse or use results in subsequent steps.

## Use Cases

1. **Complex Task Automation**
   - Research and report generation
   - Multi-step data analysis
   - Workflow orchestration

2. **Educational Tools**
   - Stepwise problem solving
   - Guided learning modules

3. **Conversational Agents**
   - Multi-turn dialogue with memory
   - Adaptive troubleshooting

4. **Business Processes**
   - Document processing pipelines
   - Automated decision trees

## When to Use Prompt Chaining/Workflow Prompts

Prompt chaining is ideal when:
- The task is too complex for a single prompt.
- Multi-step reasoning or processing is required.
- Outputs from one step inform the next.
- Automation and scalability are important.

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other techniques when:
- The task can be completed in a single prompt.
- Simpler, direct approaches are sufficient.
- The workflow is too complex to manage reliably.

## Tips for Optimization

1. **Modular Design**
   - Design each prompt as a reusable module.
   - Make it easy to swap or update steps.

2. **Structured Outputs**
   - Use consistent formats for passing data.
   - Prefer machine-readable outputs (e.g., JSON).

3. **Iterative Testing**
   - Test the chain end-to-end and step-by-step.
   - Refine prompts based on observed errors.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Include checks and fallbacks for failed steps.
   - Log intermediate results for debugging.
