# Domain-specific Prompts

Domain-specific prompting tailors the language model's behavior and outputs to specialized fields such as legal, medical, technical, or other industry-specific domains.

## Key Concepts

- **Specialized Vocabulary**: Uses terminology and phrasing unique to a particular field or industry.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Prompts are crafted with domain-specific context, assumptions, and requirements.
- **Accuracy and Compliance**: Outputs may need to meet regulatory, ethical, or professional standards.
- **Expertise Simulation**: The model is guided to act as a subject-matter expert.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Precise Language**
   - Incorporate domain-specific terms and definitions.
   - Avoid generalities; be as specific as possible.

2. **Provide Sufficient Context**
   - Include background information relevant to the domain.
   - Clarify assumptions, constraints, or standards.

3. **Reference Authoritative Sources**
   - When possible, cite guidelines, standards, or best practices from the field.
   - Encourage the model to base outputs on established knowledge.

4. **Validate Outputs**
   - Review model responses for accuracy, compliance, and appropriateness.
   - Involve domain experts in evaluation when feasible.

## Examples

### Legal Domain

```
Summarize the following contract clause in plain English, highlighting any obligations or liabilities:
{contract_clause}
```

### Medical Domain

```
Given the following patient symptoms and history, suggest possible differential diagnoses (do not provide treatment advice):
Symptoms: {symptoms}
History: {history}
```

### Technical Domain

```
Explain the function of the following code snippet in Python, focusing on data structures and algorithms used:
{code_snippet}
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Misuse of Terminology**
   - Using terms incorrectly can lead to confusion or errors.
   - Always double-check specialized language.

2. **Insufficient Context**
   - Omitting key details may result in generic or irrelevant outputs.
   - Be explicit about the domain and its requirements.

3. **Overconfidence in Model Outputs**
   - Language models may "hallucinate" facts or cite non-existent sources.
   - Never rely solely on model output for critical decisions.

## Use Cases

1. **Expert Content Generation**
   - Drafting legal memos, medical summaries, or technical documentation.

2. **Domain-specific Q&A**
   - Answering questions in specialized fields for support or education.

3. **Data Extraction and Analysis**
   - Identifying key information from domain documents (e.g., extracting clauses, symptoms, or technical specs).

## When to Use Domain-specific Prompts

Domain-specific prompting is ideal when:
- The task requires specialized knowledge or terminology.
- Outputs must meet industry or regulatory standards.
- You need to simulate expert reasoning or analysis.

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other prompting techniques when:
- The task is general-purpose or not tied to a specific field.
- The model lacks sufficient training data for the domain.
- High-stakes outputs require human expert review.

## Tips for Optimization

1. **Iterative Testing**
   - Test prompts with a range of domain inputs.
   - Refine based on feedback from domain experts.

2. **Prompt Chaining**
   - Break complex domain tasks into smaller, sequential prompts.

3. **Output Validation**
   - Use automated tools or checklists to flag potential errors or omissions.
