# Multi-agent Prompts

Multi-agent prompting coordinates multiple language models or agents, enabling collaborative, competitive, or specialized interactions to solve complex tasks.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent can be assigned a unique role, expertise, or perspective.
- **Collaboration and Competition**: Agents may work together, debate, or critique each other's outputs.
- **Orchestration**: A controller or system manages the flow of information and tasks between agents.
- **Emergent Problem Solving**: Multi-agent setups can tackle tasks that are too complex for a single model.

## Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Agent Roles**
   - Assign specific responsibilities or expertise to each agent.
   - Use explicit instructions to differentiate agent behaviors.

2. **Structure Interactions**
   - Design turn-taking, debate, or review cycles.
   - Specify how agents should respond to or build on each other's outputs.

3. **Monitor and Mediate**
   - Use a controller or moderator to resolve conflicts or synthesize results.
   - Set rules for escalation or consensus.

4. **Test for Synergy**
   - Evaluate whether multi-agent setups outperform single-agent approaches.
   - Refine agent prompts and interaction protocols as needed.

## Examples

### Collaborative Problem Solving

```
Agent 1: Analyze the following business problem and propose a solution.
Agent 2: Review Agent 1's solution, identify potential risks, and suggest improvements.
```

### Debate Format

```
Agent A: Argue in favor of implementing a four-day workweek.
Agent B: Argue against implementing a four-day workweek.
Moderator: Summarize the strongest points from both sides and provide a balanced conclusion.
```

### Specialized Agents

```
Research Agent: Gather recent studies on renewable energy adoption.
Summary Agent: Summarize the key findings from the research.
Critique Agent: Identify gaps or limitations in the summarized research.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Role Confusion**
   - Unclear or overlapping agent instructions can lead to redundant or conflicting outputs.

2. **Escalating Complexity**
   - Too many agents or interaction steps can make coordination difficult.

3. **Lack of Synthesis**
   - Failing to combine or reconcile agent outputs may result in fragmented or inconclusive results.

## Use Cases

1. **Complex Decision Making**
   - Simulating expert panels, committees, or multi-perspective analysis.

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Using reviewer or critic agents to catch errors or improve outputs.

3. **Creative Generation**
   - Brainstorming, story writing, or design tasks with multiple creative agents.

## When to Use Multi-agent Prompts

Multi-agent prompting is ideal when:
- Tasks benefit from multiple perspectives or expertise.
- You want to simulate real-world group dynamics or debates.
- Quality or creativity improves through review and iteration.

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other prompting techniques when:
- The task is simple or well-defined for a single agent.
- Coordination overhead outweighs the benefits.
- Real-time or low-latency responses are required.

## Tips for Optimization

1. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Adjust agent roles, prompts, and interaction patterns based on results.

2. **Automated Orchestration**
   - Use scripts or tools to manage agent communication and workflow.

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track outcomes to ensure multi-agent setups deliver added value.
