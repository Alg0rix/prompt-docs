# Contextual Prompts

Contextual prompting embeds relevant context, history, or external data within the prompt to help the language model generate more accurate and relevant responses. This technique is essential for tasks that require awareness of prior conversation, user preferences, or external facts.

## Key Concepts

- **Context Embedding**: Including background information, prior exchanges, or external data in the prompt.
- **History Awareness**: Leveraging previous messages or actions to inform the current response.
- **Personalization**: Adapting outputs based on user-specific details or preferences.
- **Relevance Enhancement**: Improving the accuracy and appropriateness of responses by providing more information.

## Best Practices

1. **Include Relevant Context**
   - Add only information that is necessary for the current task.
   - Avoid overloading the prompt with irrelevant details.

2. **Maintain Clarity**
   - Clearly separate context from the main instruction or question.
   - Use formatting (e.g., section headers, separators) to distinguish context.

3. **Update Context Dynamically**
   - Refresh the context as the conversation or task evolves.
   - Remove outdated or redundant information.

4. **Balance Brevity and Completeness**
   - Provide enough context for understanding, but keep prompts concise.
   - Prioritize the most important details.

## Examples

### Basic Contextual Prompt
```
Previous conversation:
User: "I'm planning a trip to Italy."
Assistant: "That sounds exciting! Which cities are you visiting?"

Current question:
User: "What are the best local foods to try there?"
```

### External Data Example
```
User profile: Name: Alex, Dietary preference: Vegetarian

Question: "What are some good dinner recipes for me?"
```

### Document Context Example
```
Document excerpt: "The company reported a 20% increase in revenue in Q1 2023, driven by strong sales in the Asia-Pacific region."

Question: "What contributed to the company's growth?"
```

### Multi-turn Conversation Example
```
Earlier in the chat:
User: "I have a dog named Max who loves to play fetch."
Assistant: "That's great! How old is Max?"

Current prompt:
User: "What are some good toys for him?"
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Irrelevant or Excessive Context**
   - Including too much or unrelated information.
   - Making the prompt confusing or overwhelming.

2. **Outdated Information**
   - Using context that is no longer accurate or relevant.
   - Failing to update context as the situation changes.

3. **Ambiguous References**
   - Not clarifying what part of the context is important.
   - Using pronouns or references without clear antecedents.

4. **Context Window Limitations**
   - Exceeding the model’s maximum input length.
   - Losing important information due to truncation.

## Use Cases

1. **Conversational AI**
   - Multi-turn chatbots
   - Virtual assistants
   - Customer support

2. **Personalization**
   - Recommendations based on user history
   - Adaptive learning systems
   - Customized content generation

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Incorporating external documents or data
   - Fact-based question answering
   - Context-aware summarization

4. **Task Continuity**
   - Remembering previous steps in a workflow
   - Carrying over user preferences or goals

## When to Use Contextual Prompts

Contextual prompting is ideal when:
- The task depends on prior conversation or user data.
- Responses need to be tailored to specific situations or individuals.
- External facts or documents are required for accuracy.
- Maintaining continuity across multiple interactions.

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other techniques when:
- The task is simple and does not require additional context.
- The context window is too limited for all necessary information.
- The model performs well with direct, standalone prompts.

## Tips for Optimization

1. **Context Pruning**
   - Regularly remove unnecessary or outdated context.
   - Focus on the most relevant details.

2. **Structured Formatting**
   - Use clear labels or sections for context and instructions.
   - Separate user data, history, and current task.

3. **Test for Relevance**
   - Check if the model uses the provided context effectively.
   - Revise context if responses are off-target.

4. **Monitor Input Length**
   - Be mindful of the model’s maximum input size.
   - Summarize or condense context when needed.
