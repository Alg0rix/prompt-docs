# Template-based Prompts

Template-based prompting uses reusable prompt templates to ensure consistency, efficiency, and scalability in generating model outputs for similar tasks or workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Reusable Structures**: Templates provide a consistent format for prompts, reducing manual effort and errors.
- **Parameterization**: Templates often include placeholders (variables) that can be filled with task-specific data.
- **Scalability**: Enables rapid generation of many prompts for similar tasks or datasets.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity in instructions, tone, and output expectations across multiple uses.

## Best Practices

1. **Design Clear Templates**
   - Use explicit instructions and formatting.
   - Clearly indicate where variables should be inserted.
   - Avoid ambiguity in template language.

2. **Parameterize Effectively**
   - Use descriptive variable names.
   - Validate input data before populating templates.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., missing or malformed data).

3. **Test and Iterate**
   - Try templates with a variety of inputs.
   - Refine based on model responses and user feedback.
   - Monitor for drift in output quality over time.

## Examples

### Basic Template

```
Summarize the following article in 3 sentences:
{article_text}
```

### Parameterized Template

```
Classify the sentiment of this review as positive, negative, or neutral.
Review: "{review_text}"
```

### Multi-field Template

```
Generate a product description using the following details:
- Product Name: {product_name}
- Features: {features}
- Target Audience: {audience}
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overly Generic Templates**
   - Avoid templates that are too broad or vague.
   - Ensure each template is tailored to its intended use case.

2. **Poor Variable Handling**
   - Failing to sanitize or validate input data can lead to errors or nonsensical prompts.
   - Watch for missing or empty variables.

3. **Lack of Testing**
   - Not testing templates with real data can result in unexpected model behavior.
   - Regularly review outputs for quality and relevance.

## Use Cases

1. **Bulk Content Generation**
   - Creating summaries, product descriptions, or emails at scale.

2. **Automated Data Labeling**
   - Generating consistent prompts for classification or extraction tasks.

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Integrating prompt templates into pipelines for customer support, research, or content moderation.

## When to Use Template-based Prompts

Template-based prompting is ideal when:
- You need to generate many similar prompts efficiently.
- Consistency and repeatability are important.
- The task structure is well-defined and varies mainly by input data.

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider other prompting techniques when:
- The task requires nuanced, context-specific instructions.
- Each prompt needs significant customization.
- The model struggles with template rigidity or lacks flexibility.

## Tips for Optimization

1. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with a simple template and improve based on results.
   - Solicit feedback from users or stakeholders.

2. **Template Versioning**
   - Track changes to templates to monitor improvements or regressions.

3. **Automated Validation**
   - Use scripts or tools to check for missing variables or formatting issues before sending prompts to the model.
